Note: Currently TensorFlow is not being supported for Python3.6x and above versions.

To Create a virtual env with specific python version here:

1. open anaconda prompt
2. go to current working directory using cd in anaconda prompt.
3. conda create -n py35 python=3.5.2
4. type y
5. configure the newly created virtual env 'venv' in pycharm as project interpreter.
set bas interpreter as C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\py35\python.exe   -------------------------->find it in the conda prompt. But this is the generally path.
6. install other necessary packages with pip in this venv or through Pycharm.
